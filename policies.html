		  <p><strong>(1) User Registration</strong>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>You need to register a DHP user first.  When you register, you need to fill in your account name, password and your own mobile phone number. We will send a short message verification code to verify whether your identity is valid.  The account has a default nickname, and you can modify and supplement your nickname and information related to your real name authentication, all of which belong to your "account information".  Account information will help us to provide you with personalized product recommendations and a better shopping experience. If you do not provide these supplementary information, the basic functions of online shopping will not be affected. </p>
		  <p>&nbsp;<strong>(2) commodity information</strong>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p> display and search
		    
		    In order for you to find the goods you need quickly, we may collect the equipment information (including equipment name, equipment model, equipment identification code, operating system and application version, language setting, resolution, service provider network ID(PLMN)) and browser type of our products and/or services to provide you with the best way to display the goods information.  We will also use your personal information to continuously improve and optimize the above functions.
		    
		    You can also search to find exactly what you need.  We will keep your search content so that you can enter it repeatedly or show you the products associated with your search content.  Please note that your search keyword information cannot identify your identity and does not belong to your personal information. We have the right to use it for any purpose.  Only when your search keyword information is used in combination with your other information and your identity can be recognized, we will use your search keyword information as your personal information during the use period, and handle and protect it together with your search history in accordance with this privacy policy. </p>
		  <p>(3) placing orders </p>
		  <p> When you are ready to settle the goods in your shopping cart, Haole Buying System will generate an order for you to purchase the goods.  You need to fill in your consignee's name, receiving address and mobile phone number in the order. At the same time, the order will specify the order number, information about the goods or services you purchased, the amount of money you should pay and the method of payment. </p>
		  <p>(4) Payment function </p>
		  <p> After you place your order, you can choose the payment services provided by the third-party payment agencies cooperating with DHP (including WeChat payment, Alipay and other payment channels, hereinafter referred to as "payment agencies").  The payment function itself does not collect your personal information, but we need to share your order number and transaction amount information with these payment agencies to confirm your payment instructions and complete the payment. </p>
		  <p>(5) Deliver product or service functions </p>
		  <p> When you place an order and complete the payment online, the third-party distribution company cooperating with DHP will complete the delivery of the order for you.  You know and agree that the third-party distribution company cooperating with DHP will use your order information in the above-mentioned links to ensure the safe delivery of the goods you ordered. </p>
		  <p>(6) customer service and after-sales functions </p>

		    To ensure the security of your account, our call center customer service will use your account information to verify your identity with you.  When you need us to provide customer service and after-sales service related to your order information, we will inquire about your order information.
